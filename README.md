For this project I did a visual analysis in Tablaeu of the overall U.S stock market and the current 3 largest companies based on market cap. 

  - Indexes included: Dow Jones, Apple, Microsoft and Nvidia

For this analysis I pulled historical data for the last 10 years on each stock ticker. I cleaned the data to have only date, close/last, high and low for each stock. I also check for any gaps in the data to ensure smooth and clean transtion when linking them together. I inputted each spreadsheet into Tableau to create my visuals. I created a chart for each ticker and cleaned them to my desired style and presentation. When you analyze the charts to can see historical economy events, individual company performance and overall US market performance. Overall market shows a large market cap lose in 2020 linked to COVID 19. Nvidia's chart shows an impressive growth in the recent years due to their part in AI (artifical intellegence).
