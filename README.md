For this analysis, I gathered historical data for the last 10 years for each stock ticker. I cleaned the data to include only the date, closing price, high, and low for each stock. I also checked for any gaps in the data to ensure a smooth transition when linking them together. I imported each spreadsheet into Tableau to create visualizations. I designed a chart for each ticker, refining them to match my desired style and presentation.

Upon analyzing the charts, you can observe historical economic events, individual company performance, and overall U.S. market performance. The overall market shows a significant loss in market capitalization in 2020, linked to COVID-19. Nvidia's chart demonstrates impressive growth in recent years, largely due to its involvement in artificial intelligence (AI).
